								<h2>About VCCUCC Education</h2>
									Each Sunday our children gather with us for worship. Following "Children's Time", they are dismissed to their Sunday School classes. We have an excellent staff of teachers...gifted and dedicated to the spiritual formation of the children of the Village Church. We use a curriculum that is rich in Biblical teaching while focusing on the application of faith to our daily lives.
								<br><br><br>
								<h2>Classes Available</h2>
									<h3>Childhood Christian Education</h3>
									
									<b><u>Atrium </b></u>– A special space designed especially for children ages 3-5. We use a curriculum called Godly Play, based on the work of Maria Montessori, Sofia Cavalletti and Jerome Berryman. The program provides a reverent, introductory, hands-on environment for our youngest students to learn Sacred Stories, Parables, Liturgical Lessons and more. Lead teachers are Rebecca Sherwood and Stephanie Granger.<br><br>

									<b><u>Kindergarten and First Grade </b></u>- Betty Smith and Julie Polucha teach a class for the Kindergarten and First grade students. Although this is a relatively small class, we feel it is best for them to have their own learning space as they are ready for a more lesson oriented environment than the Atrium, but not ready scholastically to join the second and third grade class. Betty and Julie bring many years of teaching to create an enjoyable, compassionate and effective learning experience.<br><br>

									<b><u>Second and Third Grade </b></u>– Many thanks to Jayne Bedigian, who will teach the Second and Third Grade class through November. Due to a scheduling conflict, we were in need of a teacher, and Jayne has graciously volunteered to fill in during those weeks. She brings a deep knowledge of the Bible and enjoyment of children to her teaching, and her students will benefit greatly. Kim Morrison will take over in November.<br><br>

									<b><u>Fourth and Fifth Grade </b></u>– Debbie Maturi and Kyle Sherwood team up to teach one of our largest classes. With a combination of two curriculums (Bible Quest, Hands-On Bible) they combined effectively last year, Debbie and Kyle are looking forward to another year of learning, wondering and fun.<br><br>

									<b><u>Sixth, Seventh & Eighth Grade </b></u>– We are thrilled to announce that the other large (and energetic) Sunday School class this year is taught by the returning team of Mark Morawiec (Mr. M) and Tim Reiter. With the difficult task of guiding these “tweens” to take the information they have learned in past years of Sunday School and apply it directly to their lives, present and future, Mark and Tim have proven over and over that they are up to the challenge.<br><br>

									<b><u>Children’s Chapel </b></u>– On the first Sunday of each month all classes will gather together downstairs at 11:00 for Children’s Chapel. Any parent who does not wish to have their child participate in communion; please notify their child’s Sunday School teacher or Stephanie Granger.<br><br>
									<br>
									<h3>Adult Christian Education</h3>
									<br>
									Christian Education/Spiritual Formation is important throughout our lives. At the Village Church we offer adult educational opportunities throughout the year. Past offerings have included: spiritual study, classes on prayer and faith development, and classes on parenting.<br><br>
									<br>
									<h3>Conformation Classes</h3>
									<br>
									Available to youth in grades 9 and above.
