								<p><h3>Prevention of Abuse, Neglect and False Accusations:</h3>
									
									The Village Congregational Church takes every precaution to protect children and youth from child abuse and neglect, and our volunteer staff from false accusations or appearance of potentially improper behavior, while they are participating in all scheduled programs and events.
									<br><br>
									These strategies help insure that children and adults are well protected while they are participating in scheduled classes, programs and events.
									<br><br><br>
									<h3>Sunday School</h3>
									
									&#8226; There are at least two authorized volunteers assigned to each group of children. In the event that there is only one adult present, the classroom door must remain open at all times. Whenever possible, the classroom door should be open, even with two teachers present.<br>
									&#8226; No teacher, aide or anyone else working with our children should place him/herself in a compromising situation by being alone with a child or with children out of sight of other teachers, aides or parents.<br>
									&#8226; Sunday School teachers of the Atrium through second grade will accompany their students at all times.<br>
									&#8226; Members of the Christian Education Committee or assigned adult are frequently in and out of the classrooms.<br>
									&#8226; There will be at least five years difference between the age of a teacher or aide and the oldest student in a class.<br>
									<br><br><br>
									<h3>Youth Programs and Events</h3>
									
									&#8226; All youth leaders are Authorized Supervisors. Other adult chaperones for off-site youth events will be Authorized Volunteers.<br>
									&#8226; There is an Authorized Supervisor and at least one Authorized Volunteer assigned to each youth program or event.<br>
									&#8226; Authorized Volunteers will remain with any youth whose parent/guardian is late in picking up their youth. Parents/Guardians are responsible to bring and pick up their youth and expected to do so in a timely fashion.<br>
									&#8226; Signed Permission Slips must be on file with the Christian Education Director before any youth can participate in a youth program or event taking place off Church properties.<br>
									&#8226; Physical contacts such as wrestling, horseplay or high contact games are not appropriate recreational activity. No adult leader, staff or volunteer should initiate or encourage physical or intimate contact with children or youth. Setting boundaries is the responsibility of the adults.<br>
									&#8226; Only Authorized Volunteers will be allowed to provide transportation for any youth program or event.<br>
									<br><br><br>
									<h3>Discipline Plan</h3>
									
									The purpose of discipline with children and youth is to maintain order in a manner consistent with the teaching of Christian responsibility, respect and cooperation.
									<br><br>
									Limit setting is directed toward maximizing the growth and development of the children and for protecting the group and the individuals within it. Positive reinforcement is the major tool of appropriate disciplining. Verbalize to the child when she/he is behaving in an appropriate manner. Redirect a child who appears to be “Headed for trouble.” Teachers and Aides are encouraged to listen to a child and communicate expectations of appropriate behavior. Be clear in your expectations for behavior; don’t assume a child knows what is expected. If a child is repeatedly displaying inappropriate behavior, and redirecting has not worked, and talking to the child has not worked, the student should be brought to the Sanctuary to participate in the Worship Service with his/her parents/Guardians.
									<br><br><br>
									<h3>The Village Congregational Church will NEVER:</h3>
									<br>
									&#8226; Use corporal punishment, including spanking, hitting, slapping or any form of physical punishment.<br>
									&#8226; Subject a child to verbal reprimands in the form of destructive criticism, insults or shouting.<br>
									&#8226; Deny any child food as a form of punishment.<br>
									&#8226; Punish any child for soiling, wetting or not using the toilet.<br>
									&#8226; Force a student to participate in an activity which they are honestly uncomfortable with.<br>
									<br><br><br>
									<h3>Toileting Procedure</h3>
									
									Children in the Atrium through second grade should be accompanied to the rest room inside the nursery room on the first floor. Third through eighth grade may be allowed to go and return to class on their own if the teacher feels they are responsible enough to do so.
									<br><br>
									Children will wash their hands with soap and running water after toileting. Staff members and volunteers will wash their hands with soap and running water after assisting children with toileting or toileting themselves. Individual paper towels will be used to dry hands.
									<br><br><br>
									<h3>Diaper Policy</h3>
									
									Nursery workers will change diapers when deemed necessary. Families must remove soiled diapers from the premises
									<br><br><br>
									<h3>First Aid and CPR</h3>
									
									There will be a small first-aid kit in each classroom, and a larger one on each floor for the use of all classes on that floor.
									<br><br>
									The Village Congregational Church will offer, in conjunction with the Red Cross, First Aid and CPR training to all teachers and volunteer staff at least every two years. This course should be open to any member of the congregation who is interested.
									<br><br><br>
									<h3>Mandated Reporters</h3>
									
									As an authorized Supervisor or Authorized Volunteer providing care and programming for the children, youth and adults of the Village Congregational Church, you need to be aware of two state departments that are responsible for this area: the Department of Social Services (DSS), which handles all reports and investigations of child abuse; and the Office for Children (OFC), which licenses all child care facilities. Allegations regarding abuse of adults should be reported to the local police.
									<br><br>
									Staff and volunteers of the Village Congregational Church are required to report known or suspected instances of abuse to the Safe Church Committee (Mandated Reporters).
									<br><br>
									Mandated reporters include: physicians, medical interns, hospital personnel, medical examiners, psychologists, emergency medical technicians, dentists, nurses, chiropractors, podiatrists, osteopaths, public or private school teachers, educational administrators, guidance or family counselors, probation officers, social workers, foster parents, firefighters and police officers.
									<br><br>
									The Village Congregational Churches Safe Church Policy includes pastor(s), church staff and three mandated reporters in this number. These volunteers are chosen from the congregation and will act in conjunction with the church staff.
									<br><br>
									There is a legal mandate to file a report with the Safe Church Committee if you believe that:<br>
								
									(a) a child or adult is suffering from serious physical or emotional injury resulting from abuse inflicted on him/her, including sexual abuse.<br>
									(b) a child or adult is suffering from neglect including malnutrition.<br>
									(c) A child is physically dependent upon an addictive drug at birth.<br><br>
									Once you have determined that a report is necessary, contact a member of the Safe Church Committee (Mandated Reporter). That person will assist you in filling out the Incident Report Form. If you feel that there is immediate physical danger, call the police and then inform the pastor(s). Your name will not be identified on the form. The mandated reporter of the church will be identified on the form. All mandated and required reporters are immune by law from civil or criminal liability or filing a report.<br>
									<br>
									The Safe Church Committee or their representative has the right to find out the results of any investigation arising from a mandated report.
									<br><br>
									If a child in your care shows signs of an untreated injury, one that needs immediate medical attention, report it immediately to the pastor(s). If action must be taken arrangements will be made for immediate transportation by ambulance. The pastor(s) will convey appropriate information to the parent/guardian.
